Hello, Iâ€™m [STATIC]
I've been working on a project called 'DELETED 0.6.2'.
DELETED 0.6.2 is an AI that is perfect in any way.
DELETED 0.6.2 is unable to feel anxiety, fear, anger, and sadness.
DELETED is only created to chat and help humans.
DELETED 0.6.2 can't attack or become violent in any way.
The original creator of DELETED has been missing for some time now. In other words, we don't know what DELETED is actually made out of. And if this version of DELETED fails, we wouldn't be able to create another one.
(You can chat with DELETED on C.AI.)
